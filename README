cockpit-abrt
============

This Cockpit module adds a new item called Problems to the Tools menu. The
module displays list of problems detect by ABRT and allows its users to view
problem details and report the problems to external bug trackers.

Overview
--------

The module gets the displayed data from `org.freedesktop.problems` D-Bus service:
https://jfilak.fedorapeople.org/ProblemsAPI/


Installation

First of all you need to install ABRT problem hooks and ABRT's implementation
of the Problems D-Bus service:
